      <h2>What is Elote?</h2>

      <p>
        Elote, or Mexican corn on the cob, is a popular street food in Mexico
        (that's why it's also known as Mexican street corn). Corn on the cob is
        charred on the grill, slathered with butter and mayonnaise, and finished
        with salty Cotija cheese.
      </p>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients-list">
        <li>
          Corn: This elote recipe makes four servings, so you'll need four
          shucked corn cobs.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Butter and mayonnaise: The grilled corn is rolled in melted butter and
          mayonnaise, resulting in a rich and flavorful finished product.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Cheese: You can find Cotija, a salty and crumbly cheese, in most
          grocery stores.
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          Lime: A lime wedge (for serving) is optional, but it adds a bright pop
          of flavor.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <strong>Tip:</strong>
      For a bit of color and heat, lightly dust the elote with chili powder,
      tajin seasoning, or cayenne pepper before serving. Fresh cilantro is also
      a tasty addition.
